Requirements
The goal of this project is to build a software that can run a chess match between either
between two players(PVP), or between a player and an AI bot (PVB).

Player vs Player (PVP)
This is one of two major components of the software. We cannot implement the player vs bot (PVB)
mode until after this is completley and accurately implemented .

  Design:
    The current approach I have in mind to desgin and implement the PVP componenet is to 
    leverage an object oriented approach to handle pieces, the board, and the game state.


- player vs player moode
- player vs bot (AI) mode
