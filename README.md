Quick Description: 
The current goal of this project is to build a fully functional chess engine for
Player vs Player (PVP) and (Player vs Bot) game modes. 

The meaning of the word "engine" according to the current status of this project refers to
a functioning porgram that can handle player vs player and player vs bot game modes. Where 
the "bot" is implemented via minimax algorithm. 

The more familiar expectations in regards to "chess engines" are computer programs that
can analyze chess positions and generate a list of the strongest moves. Though the 
minimax algorithm kind of does this at a much smaller scale, this isnt currently our primary goal.
